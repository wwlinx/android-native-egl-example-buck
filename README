Android Native EGL example
--------------------------

This project demonstrates how to combine Java application with native
C/C++ code for OpenGL rendering.  It shows how to do rendering without
GLSurfaceView and GLSurfaceView.Renderer Java classes.

Java part of the sample application is responsible for the main UI and
application lifecycle.  It creates empty SurfaceView and passes that
to the native code.  Native code uses that for OpenGL rendering.

Native code starts a new thread which executes rendering code.  It
uses EGL API to set up rendering context for the thread.


Requirements
------------

Android API level 9 and Android NDK r5 


Acknowledgments
---------------

The EGL setup code was adapted from Android NDK native-activity sample.

The OpenGL cube was adapted from Android SDK Graphics ApiDemos.
